Hi, my name is __Nigel Armstrong__. Currently a software engineer at Google.

Previously:

* QA Software Engineer at [Brain Corp](http://braincorp.com) where I developed an integration testing framework for robots in python.
* Lead Software Engineer at [comma.ai](https://comma.ai) where I, for a short time, contributed to building the android of self-driving cars.
* Controls Engineer at [Swisslog](http://swisslog.com) implementing large industrial controls system for automated conveyors and cranes.

I studied Computer Engineering at [Christopher Newport University](http://cnu.edu/academics/departments/pcse/majorsminors/computerengineering/).
When I was a student, I was involved in many extracurricular activities, but I spent most of my time as the Team Captain for the
Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) [Competition Team](https://github.com/cnuuaslab). The team designs, builds, and fly autonomous vehicles. 
They conduct undergraduate research in autonomous systems and work to compete in the [AUVSI SUAS competition](http://www.auvsi-seafarer.org/) each summer. 
Under my direction the team won the Dr. Arthur Reyes Memorial Safety Award in 2015 and the Just Joe Sportsmanship Award in 2016.
