Hi, my name is __Nigel Armstrong__. I work as a Controls Engineer for [Swisslog](http://swisslog.com).

In my free time I support the [AUVSI Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) Competition](http://auvsi-suas.org) that I used to compete in.

I studied Computer Engineering at [Christopher Newport University](http://cnu.edu/academics/departments/pcse/majorsminors/computerengineering/).
When I was a student, I was involved in many extracurricular activities including:

 * President of the Student chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
 * Team Captain and Mission Commander for the [Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) Competition Team](https://github.com/cnuuaslab)
 * Active member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
 * Active member of the [Linux Users Group (LUG)](//cnulug.org)

My largest involvement was with the Unmanned Aerial Systems Team. The team designs, builds, and fly autonomous vehicles, including multirotors (quadcopters and hexacopters) and planes.
We conduct undergraduate research in autonomous systems and work to compete in the [AUVSI SUAS competition](http://www.auvsi-seafarer.org/) each summer.
