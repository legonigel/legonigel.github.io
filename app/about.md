Hi, my name is __Nigel Armstrong__. I love Python and Linux.

Previously, I have worked as a software engineer at [comma.ai](https://comma.ai). comma.ai is building the android of self-driving cars. 

Before that I was a Controls Engineer for [Swisslog](http://swisslog.com) implementing large industrial controls system for automated conveyors and cranes.

I studied Computer Engineering at [Christopher Newport University](http://cnu.edu/academics/departments/pcse/majorsminors/computerengineering/).
When I was a student, I was involved in many extracurricular activities, but I spent most of my time as the Team Captain for the Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) [Competition Team](https://github.com/cnuuaslab)

The team designs, builds, and fly autonomous vehicles, including multirotors (quadcopters and hexacopters) and planes.
They conduct undergraduate research in autonomous systems and work to compete in the [AUVSI SUAS competition](http://www.auvsi-seafarer.org/) each summer. Under my direction the team won the Dr. Arthur Reyes Memorial Safety Award in 2015 and the Just Joe Sportsmanship Award in 2016.
