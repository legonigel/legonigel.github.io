Hi, my name is __Nigel Armstrong__. I'm currently a student at [Christopher Newport University](http://cnu.edu/pcs/academics/ce.asp) studying Computer Engineering.

I am involved in many extracurricular activities including:

 * President of the Student chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
 * Team Captain and Mission Commander for the [Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) Competition Team](//uas.pcs.cnu.edu)
 * Active member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
 * Active member of the [Linux Users Group (LUG)](//cnulug.org)
 
My largest involvment is with the Unmanned Aerial Systems Team. Our team designs, builds, and fly autonomous vehicles, including multirotors (quadcopters and hexacopters) and planes. 
We conduct undergraduate research in autonomous systems and prepare to compete in the [AUVSI SUAS competition](http://www.auvsi-seafarer.org/) each summer.
This is my second year as Mission Commander for the team and my first year as Team Captain.
